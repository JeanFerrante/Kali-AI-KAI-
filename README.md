# Kali-AI-KAI- 
I am creating a Artificial Intelligence that can try to crash systems 24/7 and then improve cybersecurity worldwide. 
First fase: Create a virtual enviroment to test Kali AI (done!) 
Second fase: Create Kali AI (KAI) (in process) 
Third fase: Start Learning process with KAI (Until the end of 2022) 
Fourth fase: Create Kali Defensor Builder (KDB) (until the end of 2023) 
fifth fase: Create Crypto token KaliAi (KAI) then the whitepaper of PoCs or Proof of Cybersecurity where holders will be able to stake KAI and using PoS (proof of stake) will earn interest on the token. It will be created 100.000.000 tokens each transaction will burn 1%, and companies that want to use KAI and KADB will have to pay for it using this currencies/tokens. Also, developers will be rewarded with 1 KAI when collaborating with more than 1% of the actual knowledge data of KAI while fixing bugs or other problems that can occur in the processes.
